# Learning Progress

I am a lifelong learner. Beyond academic studies, I love dedicating time to explore new concepts across various fields. I am particularly fascinated by the "Sinosphere" (the culture and languages of East Asia).

> ### Ancient Languages
>
> Languages are windows to understanding history and culture.
>
> - **Classical Chinese (文言文):** <span class="badge">Intermediate</span><br> I can read and write standard texts, though highly complex works like the <i>Shi Jing</i> (詩經) remain challenging.
> - **Classical Japanese (古文):** <span class="badge">Intermediate</span><br> I can read and write <i>Kakikudashibun</i> (書き下し文) for <i>Kanbun Kundoku</i> (漢文訓読). Currently focusing on reading <i>Waka</i> (和歌) poetry and the <i>Makura no Soshi</i> (枕草子).
> - **Latin:** <span class="badge">Intermediate</span><br> I regularly read and write texts of moderate difficulty.
> - **Ancient Greek:** <span class="badge">Beginner</span><br> Currently learning the alphabet and basic syntax to better understand the roots of European culture.

> ### Modern Languages
>
> - **Chinese (中文):** <span class="badge">Native / Fluent</span><br> Cantonese (native) and Mandarin (fluent, near-native).
> - **Japanese (日本語):** <span class="badge">JLPT N1</span><br> Capable of communicating fluently on a wide variety of topics.
> - **English:** <span class="badge">CET-6</span><br> Comfortable communicating on general and academic topics.
> - **Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt):** <span class="badge">Post-Beginner</span><br> Leveraging my knowledge of the ancient <i>Chữ Nôm</i> script to facilitate the learning process.
> - **Korean (한국어):** <span class="badge">Post-Beginner</span><br> Transitioning smoothly from Japanese due to grammatical similarities.
> - **Portuguese (Português):** <span class="badge">Beginner</span><br> Learning foundational grammar, bridging over from Latin. As someone from Macau, studying this language is deeply important for understanding my heritage.
> - **German (Deutsch):** <span class="badge">Beginner</span><br> Just starting with the basics.

> ### Mathematics
>
> My ultimate devotion lies in number theory and analysis.
>
> - **Calculus and Integrals:** I greatly enjoy solving complex equations and integrals online. Explaining and debating integration techniques brings me immense joy. You can find me discussing these topics over on my <i>Threads</i> account.
> - **Higher Mathematics ("Napkin" Project):** Currently studying the renowned work <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html" target="_blank"><i>An Infinitely Large Napkin</i></a> by Evan Chen, aiming to familiarize myself with advanced mathematical theories such as abstract algebra and topology.

> ### Computer Science
>
> - **Fuzzing and Security:** Continuously writing scripts to uncover bugs in binary compilation using ASAN.
> - **Artificial Intelligence:** Beyond <i>Computer Vision</i>, I am now focusing heavily on <i>Semantic Segmentation</i> and Large Language Models (LLMs) for deeper data comprehension.
